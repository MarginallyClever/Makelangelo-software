## Contributing new code

Please see the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Makelangelo-software/wiki/Getting-Started) to get setup and running.

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Write tests for your code.
3. Write code that passes your tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Send in your [pull request](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Makelangelo-software/pulls).
6. Discuss the changes with the team.
7. Get the code approved and merged into the `master` branch.
