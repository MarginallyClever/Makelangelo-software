A mural drawing robot and a gentle introduction to 3D printing.

Makelangelo is a polargraph mural drawing robot. It is intended to teach students about programming, physics, trigonometry, and electronics in a fun, goal-oriented way. Makelangelo is scalable: our test models have ranged from 30cm^2 to 300cm^2.

This project specifically deals with the GUI: the computer program that makes running the robot friendly and easy. It pairs really well with Makelangelo-firmware, the code in the brain of the robot that receives instructions and moves the motors.

## Running

The Makelangelo Java Application requires the [Java SE Development Kit 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) to run.

## Compiling
