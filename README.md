# Makelangelo Software

Makelangelo Software is a Java program that prepares art for CNC plotters.  It is especially designed for the [Makelangelo Robot](http://www.makelangelo.com/).

It pairs really well with [Marlin 3D printer firmware](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Marlin-polargraph), the code in the brain of the robot that receives instructions and moves the motors.

# Start!

Steps to get started:

1. Install The latest OpenJDK (java software)
2. Grab a nightly build and run it directly *or* Install Makelangelo Software App from the source

Then you should be able to run the application.

## 1. Install The latest OpenJDK

Get the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) https://openjdk.java.net/. The minimum required version 17.

- **OSX**: Unarchive the OpenJDK tar, and place the resulting folder (i.e. jdk-17.jdk) into your `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/` folder since this is the standard and expected location of JDK installs. You can also install anywhere you want in reality.
- **Windows**: https://stackoverflow.com/a/52531093 _untested_
- **Linux**: https://linuxize.com/post/install-java-on-ubuntu-18-04/ _untested_

## 2. Grab a nightly build

Download a [nightly build](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Makelangelo-software/releases/tag/Nightly) corresponding to the latest commit from master. Depending on your OS, double clic on the file starting with `makelangelo-nightly-` or run the following command:
```
java -jar makelangelo-nightly-XXXXX.jar
```

🎉 Application should now launch.

## 2 bis. Install Makelangelo Software App from the source

* Goto https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Makelangelo-software/
* Download this zip file: https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Makelangelo-software/archive/refs/heads/master.zip and extract it. Note the folder for later.

2 options are available for building the application:
- with Eclipse: fully graphical but long
- with Maven in a console: fast and reliable

### Eclipse IDE building
* Go to Eclipse website: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/, choose "Eclipse IDE for Java developers" and install the latest version.
* Launch "Eclipse IDE" when done and go to File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects > Next > (folder from previous step) > Finish
* If you see the "Welcome!" tab, close it.
* select Run > Debug As > Java Application
* select "Makelangelo - com.marginallyclever.makelangelo" and click OK. (It should be the top of the list)
* Wait while the progress bar in the bottom right fills up. This is a one time thing while it installs other dependencies and packages and puts everything together.
* "Errors exist...Proceed with launch?" Select Proceed.

🎉 Application should now launch.

### Console building
* Open a terminal emulator (`cmd` on Windows, `Terminal` on macOS or GNU/Linux) in the extracted folder.
* Build the application with `mvnw` (the first time, it downloads a lot of files):
  * `./mvnw clean install` on macOS or GNU/Linux
  * `mvnw.cmd clean install` on Windows
* in the `target/` folder, launch the jar file with a name like : `Makelangelo*-with-dependencies.jar`
  * double click on it OR
  * in the previously opened console, run `java -jar target/Makelangelo*-with-dependencies.jar`

🎉 Application should now launch.

## Development

When launching the application, set the environnement variable `DEV` to `true` in order to get the application log on the stdout.
