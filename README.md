Makelangelo Software is a Java program that prepares art for CNC plotters.  It was originally designed for the
[Makelangelo Art Robot](http://www.makelangelo.com/).  It runs in Windows, OSX, and several flavors of linux.

It pairs really well with [Marlin 3D printer firmware](https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Marlin-polargraph/tree/2.1.x-polargraph), the code in the brain of the robot that receives instructions and moves the motors.
