A mural drawing robot and a gentle introduction to 3D printing.

Makelangelo is a polargraph mural drawing robot.  It is intended to teach students about programming, physics, trigonometry, and electronics in a fun, goal-oriented way.  Makelangelo is scalable: our test models have ranged from 30cm^2 to 300cm^2.

This project specifically deals with the GUI: the computer program that makes running the robot friendly and easy.  It pairs really well with Makelangelo-firmware, the code in the brain of the robot that receives instructions and moves the motors.

Makelangelo is derived from the work of Paul Fisher.  It is largely inspired by "Hektor":http://hektor.ch/ by Jürg Lehni and Uli Franke.
